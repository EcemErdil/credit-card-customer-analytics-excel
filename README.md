# Credit Card Customer Analytics
## Advanced Excel End-to-End Business Intelligence Project

---

## Business Problem
Banks need to understand customer profitability, churn risk, and spending behavior in order to make data-driven strategic decisions.  
This project analyzes credit card customer data to identify risk segments, revenue opportunities, and optimization strategies using advanced Excel analytics techniques.

---

## Dataset
The analysis is based on 10,127 credit card customers including:

- Demographic attributes
- Financial variables (credit limits, balances, payments)
- Behavioral indicators (transaction volume, utilization patterns)
- Customer activity metrics

---

## Analytical Workflow
The project follows an end-to-end analytical pipeline:

- Data cleaning and transformation using Power Query
- Data modeling and KPI calculation
- Customer segmentation and behavioral analysis using Pivot Tables
- Scenario and optimization analysis using Goal Seek and Solver
- Executive dashboard design for decision-makers
- Automated reporting infrastructure using Excel VBA

---

## Key Insights
- Overall customer churn rate is 16.07%
- Loyal customer segments generate significantly higher revenue contribution
- High-risk customers show lower transaction volume and weaker payment behavior
- Credit limit increases show a direct positive relationship with transaction volume
- Achieving 85M TL transaction volume requires approximately 90.6% credit limit optimization
- Reaching 1.5M TL monthly revenue requires approximately 23,957 active customers

---

## Strategic Recommendations
- Implement segment-based targeted campaigns to increase customer lifetime value
- Apply risk-focused preventive actions for high-risk customers
- Optimize credit limit strategies to drive transaction growth
- Use the automated dashboard for continuous decision-support monitoring
